    Outside of research, I am also enthusiastic in learning and doing computer related projects. The following are some of my projects done over the pass years.

        | #[b #[abbr(title="thermally activated delatyed fluorescence") TADF]] is a process in organic molecules, especially in OLED materials, that triplet exciton states can thermally activated back to singlet exciton states and then fluoresce. TADF process is usually weak and ineffecient, but recent #[a(href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v492/n7428/full/nature11687.html", target="_blank") papers] had shown efficient TADF on carefully designed molecules, with efficiencies on par with phosphorescence OLED (~20%). TADF has open up possibilities for new OLED material designs. Our goal is to find efficient blue OLED emitter with automated molecules generation and machine learning.
