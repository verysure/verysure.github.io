    My current research focuses on thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF)
    #[abbr(title="organic light-emitting device") OLED] materials.
    I have also worked on singlet fission in organic photovoltaics.
    During undergraduate, my research was mainly on dye-sensitized solar cell.

        #[b #[abbr(title="thermally activated delatyed fluorescence") TADF]]
        is a process in organic molecules, especially in OLED materials, that
        triplet exciton states can thermally activated back to singlet exciton states and then fluoresce.
        TADF process is usually weak and ineffecient, but recent 
        #[a(href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v492/n7428/full/nature11687.html", target="_blank") papers] 
        had shown efficient TADF 
        on carefully designed molecules, with efficiencies on par with phosphorescence OLED (~20%). <br><br>
        TADF has open up possibilities for new OLED material designs. Our goal is to find efficient blue OLED,
        which is still a missing piece in current OLED industry.

        #[b Singlet Fission] in organic semiconductor is a phenomenon 
        that a singlet exciton dissociates into two triplet excitons. 
        The process is very efficient due to fast singlet fission rate and spin dependence transition.
        By pairing singlet fission materials with suitable low bandgap energy materials, 
        the conversion efficiency of the photovoltaic cell could potentially exceed Shockley-Queisser limit.
        My research on singlet fission is to understand its mechanism and singlet fission efficiency in tetracene.
