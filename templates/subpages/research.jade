    My current research focuses on thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF)
    #[abbr(title="organic light-emitting device") OLED] materials.
    I have also worked on singlet fission in organic photovoltaics.
    During undergraduate, my research was mainly on dye-sensitized solar cell.

        | #[b #[abbr(title="thermally activated delatyed fluorescence") TADF]] is a process in organic molecules, especially in OLED materials, that triplet exciton states can thermally activated back to singlet exciton states and then fluoresce. TADF process is usually weak and ineffecient, but recent #[a(href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v492/n7428/full/nature11687.html", target="_blank") papers] had shown efficient TADF on carefully designed molecules, with efficiencies on par with phosphorescence OLED (~20%). TADF has open up possibilities for new OLED material designs. Our goal is to find efficient blue OLED emitter with automated molecules generation and machine learning.

        #[b Singlet Fission] in organic semiconductor is a phenomenon that a singlet exciton dissociates into two triplet excitons. The process is very efficient due to fast singlet fission rate and spin dependence transition. By pairing singlet fission materials with suitable low bandgap energy materials, the conversion efficiency of the photovoltaic cell could potentially exceed Shockley-Queisser limit. My research on singlet fission is to understand its mechanism and singlet fission efficiency in tetracene.
